the to-do list:

	higher priority:
		finish adding features:
		- add deleting playlists
		- allow creation of playlists from within application
	- refactor everything because i stopped working on this for a week and
	  forgot my mental map;  everything looks TERRIBLE now!!!!

	lower priority:
		add eye candy:
		- make the GUI look nice
		- add customisation such as an accent colour
	- make all strings come from something like .csv file for multi-language
	  support
